There was an explosion at Dr. Connors' lab. Get down there now and get me some pictures!"~00~I'll get your pictures, Fuzzhead... but as Spider-Man!"~00~"There was a fight of some sort before the explosion. Too bad Dr. Connors is missing, he could give us some answers."~00~"Forget that! The Lizard's been spotted in the subway! We'll have to get back to this case later!"~00~"Doc Connors must have transformed again! I better get him the antidote before he hurts someone."~00~"Oh, no -- Venom!!!"~00~"What's going on? Old Slobber-Mouth is usually a lot stronger."~00~"Whoa, he's gone! But I can't chase after him now, I've got to get to the subway!"~00~"That antidote seems to have done the trick!"~00~"Somebody broke into my lab... a man on a glider..."~00~"The Hobgoblin! But why would he want lab equipment?"~00~"It's you again! Why did you attack me?"~00~"Recently, many of us have disappeared, so we were afraid. But you have stopped the lizard monster, and we want to help you. The glider man you seek hides out at the docks."~00~"Well, I'm here... I wonder where the Hobgoblin is hiding?"~00~"Gentlemen, it appears our meeting is at an end. Please take care of this intruder."~00~"Yikes! Sorry to crash your party, guys!"~00~"Venom, wait!"~00~"He's gone again! That's twice already! Something weird is going on, but I'll have to figure it out later... I have a date with the Hobgoblin!"~00~"Hello, anybody home?"~00~"Oh no! There are pumpkin bombs everywhere! I've got to defuse them, or I'm toast!"~00~"Your time's up, Goblin! What were you looking for in Connors' lab?"~00~"I wasn't paid to talk, Bug-Breath!"~00~"Who put you up to this, Funboy?"~00~"It doesn't matter Spider-Man... you're too late!"~00~"The cops will have to deal with the Hobgoblin for now... It's almost 2 AM and I need to get these pictures to Jonah in time for the morning edition!"~00~"I was up all night, but I still don't have any more clues. The Hobgoblin was no help... Who hired him? And for what?"~00~"Then there's that sophisticated lab equipment... This could be bigger than I thought."~00~"Venom!!!"~00~"Was barely able to escape..."~00~"...experiments..."~00~"...Carnage..."~00~"...ultimate evil..."~00~"What? Where?"~00~"Sewer..."~00~"...floodgate... 242..."~00~"You must stop it..."~00~"He's passed out! He'd been trying to warn me all along!"~00~"Well, it looks like I'm going back to the sewers. I should have brought my rubber underwear!"~00~"What is this place?"~00~"Well done Spider-Man, you've discovered my lab."~00~"Impressive, isn't it? Allow my guests to give you a tour..."~00~"They're dying to meet you!"~00~"The game's over, Carnage! Here I am! Show yourself!"~00~"Sorry, Spider-Man, I'm afraid Carnage is a little indisposed at the moment."~00~"What? Dr. Octopus!"~00~"I've experienced a few setbacks, but soon I will have all the abilities of this alien costume. Unlike the other hosts, however, I will have complete control over my symbiote!"~00~"Venom may have escaped, but you won't be so lucky!"~00~"Oh no! Carnage!"~00~"Dr. Octopus will pay for messing with me... but only after I rip you to shreds!"~00~"Final score: Spider-Man 2, Super-Villains 0!
