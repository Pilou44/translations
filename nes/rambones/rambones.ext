Colonel Trautman~FF~visits Rambo in the~FF~military prison.~FF~~FF~
Rambo,I want to~FF~send you on~FF~a Mission.~FF~~FF~
It's dangerous,but~FF~you'll be free~FF~if you succeed.~FF~~FF~
Our men are still~FF~missing~FF~~FF~
in a jungle~FF~in Vietnam.We~FF~believe they are~FF~alive,prisoners of~FF~the enemy.~FF~~FF~
Your mission is to~FF~sneak into the~FF~enemy camp and find~FF~them.~FF~Are you up to it?~FF~~FF~
I'm not afraid of~FF~death.~FF~ ~FF~I feel better in~FF~prison.~FF~~FF~
Good,I'll make the~FF~arrangements.~FF~~FF~
But it's up to you.~FF~The game doesn't~FF~start until you~FF~say YES.~FF~~FF~
I'm~FF~Commander Murdock.~FF~~FF~
We want you to get~FF~into enemy~FF~territory and take~FF~photographs of the~FF~POW camp.~FF~~FF~
You're not to~FF~engage the enemy.~FF~~FF~
Photos? Not rescue~FF~them?~FF~~FF~
I repeat.You're not~FF~to engage the~FF~enemy.~FF~~FF~
Go to the weapons~FF~center and~FF~get ready.~FF~~FF~
We can't give you~FF~weapons without~FF~Murdock's~FF~permission.~FF~~FF~
I picked some~FF~weapons for~FF~your mission.~FF~~FF~
Go to Trautman.~FF~~FF~
Rambo,forget about~FF~your absurd hand-to~FF~-hand fighting.~FF~Military technology~FF~will work best.~FF~~FF~
~FF~Go to the hangar.~FF~~FF~
There's a contact~FF~man Co,over~FF~there.He'll guide~FF~you in the jungle.~FF~~FF~
You've got 36 hours~FF~to get in,complete~FF~your assignment,~FF~and get out alive.~FF~~FF~
If you get in~FF~trouble,try to~FF~reach the~FF~extraction site~FF~marked on the map.~FF~~FF~
Rambo···~FF~Good luck.~FF~~FF~
I'm Co.~FF~You did not expect~FF~a woman?~FF~~FF~
Would you like to~FF~know something?~FF~~FF~
Where is the camp?~FF~ ~FF~ ~FF~What do you think~FF~about me?~FF~~FF~
What?~FF~You look good.~FF~~FF~
The camp is located~FF~in the jungle to~FF~the East of the~FF~river.~FF~~FF~
I've arranged~FF~a boat.Let's go to~FF~the dock.~FF~~FF~
You're outsiders,~FF~aren't you.~FF~~FF~
Sorry,we can't~FF~allow strangers~FF~to get on our boat.~FF~~FF~
What? You should~FF~know us.We wanna~FF~get on the boat.~FF~Here's money.~FF~~FF~
OK~FF~~FF~
Get on,hurry.~FF~~FF~
Rambo,something's~FF~strange.~FF~~FF~
Look! That's an~FF~enemy boat.~FF~You sold us!~FF~~FF~
Right,We do~FF~everything for~FF~money.Don't move.~FF~~FF~
What does this~FF~pendant mean?~FF~~FF~
It brings me good~FF~luck.~FF~~FF~
Rambo,keep this~FF~pendant.~FF~Please take care~FF~of it.~FF~~FF~
Now,here we are.~FF~We'll have to walk~FF~from here~FF~to the camp.~FF~~FF~
Let's go~FF~search the village.~FF~You'll find it~FF~in the East.~FF~~FF~
The camp is located~FF~South from here.~FF~~FF~
Cross the river~FF~to the West,and~FF~climb the hill,~FF~then you'll find~FF~the pick-up point.~FF~~FF~
But,we're late~FF~for the contact~FF~time.~FF~~FF~
The helicopter~FF~won't come any~FF~more.~FF~We'd better hide~FF~in the village.~FF~~FF~
AHHH···!~FF~AHH···!~FF~~FF~
I'll help you.~FF~~FF~
~FF~I'm so happy to~FF~see you're safe.~FF~~FF~
What?~FF~Did you take the~FF~POW out?~FF~~FF~
You were supposed~FF~to take photos~FF~only!~FF~~FF~
