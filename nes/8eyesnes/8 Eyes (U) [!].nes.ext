;00016036{ CONGRATULATIONS ORIN!!                             In fighting your way      through the eight      Perilous castles, you    have proved that your       swordsmanship and      falconry talents are    great. In solving the     riddle of the eight    jewels, you have proved  your skill as a logician. These were great tests   of skill, and only the   strongest of warriors      and the wisest of       scholars could have     completed this quest.     I realize that there    is only one thing more   gratifying than coming   to the end of a great   game, that is realizing   the challenge has just    begun.   Go now Orin,    another quest awaits.  In this second adventure,  your skills will be     tested as never before. If you are truly skilled,   you may be able to      finish some of it !          GOOD LUCK !         Here is the password to  the most challenging    adventure of your life !         PASSWORD                TAXANTAXAN                                      push start key       Well, well. You managed    to beat the second      challenge of [\Eyes.        Unbelievable !       Your video game talents  are among the best the     world has to offer.      You confronted the    challenge I set for you, and triumphed undisputed.
