IN HORROR, WOODY SEES SID, A KID WHO'SCRUEL TO ALL HIS TOYS, CONTROLS THE   CLAW... AND HE PLANS ON GETTING BUZZ!    "YOU MUST NOT FIGHT THE WILL OF                 THE CLAW!"                                                           "ALL MUST OBEY THE CLAW!"

WOODY, TRYING TO KEEP BUZZ FROM BEING TAKEN, GRABS BUZZ'S LEGS AND BEFORE   HE CAN LET GO, IS LIFTED UP INTO THE  AIR AS WELL,                                                                SMILING, SID MOVES BOTH TOYS TOWARDS  THE PRIZE CHUTE.

SID STUFFS HIS NEW TOYS DEEP INTO HIS BACKPACK AND, WITH A SECOND EVIL LAUGHHEADS HOME TO...PLAY.                 SID CLOSES THE DOOR TO HIS BEDROOM ANDPULLS WOODY OUT OF HIS BACKPACK.                                            LIFTING UP A LARGE MAGNIFYING GLASS   TO CATCH THE SUN, SID TRAINS THE SPOT OF HOT LIGHT ON WOODY'S FOREHEAD...                                         "WHERE ARE YOUR REBEL FRIENDS NOW?!"  WHEN SID IS CALLED DOWNSTAIRS BY HIS  MOTHER, IT GIVES WOODY A CHANCE TO    LOOK AROUND THE BEDROOM FOR BUZZ...   WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO HIM?                                            AND UNKNOWN TO WOODY, LURKING IN THE  DARK SHADOWS, SOMETHING WAS WATCHING  HIS EVERY MOVE VERY CLOSELY...        "COME ON BUZZ, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!"                                      "WOODY, I'M NOT REALLY A SPACE RANGER.I'M JUST A TOY.  JUST A CHILD'S TOY."                                       "BUZZ, LISTEN TO ME, YOU'RE NOT ANY   CHILD'S TOY: YOU'RE ANDY'S TOY... AND YOU'RE HIS FAVORITE.  I...  UH OH..." "...SID!"                                                                   WITH AN EVIL LAUGH, SID PICKS UP BUZZ AND STRAPS A LARGE ROCKET TO HIS BACK.                                         "HOUSTON: WE ARE GO FOR LAUNCH!"                                           LAUGHING, SID TAKES BUZZ OUTSIDE.   WOODY, WITH LITTLE TIME TO SAVE BUZZ, CALLS OUT TO THE MUTANT TOYS...                                             "LOOK, THERE'S A GOOD TOY OUT THERE...AND HE NEEDS YOUR HELP... PLEASE."                                          THE TOYS WILL HELP, BUT TO GET TO BUZZTHEY'LL HAVE TO FACE SCUD, SID'S DOG! THE TOYS SAVE BUZZ BY SHOWING SID THEYARE REALLY ALIVE, WHICH SCARES SID SO BAD HE VOWS NEVER TO HURT TOYS AGAIN!                                       THE TOYS CELEBRATE UNTIL WOODY SEES A TRUCK LEAVING ANDY'S HOUSE NEXT DOOR.                                       "BUZZ!  ANDY'S MOVING WITHOUT US!"       "THANKS FOR COMING BACK, WOODY!"                                          "NO PROBLEM, BUZZ, BUT RIGHT NOW WE   HAVE TO CATCH BACK UP TO THAT MOVING  VAN BEFORE WE END UP AS LOST TOYS!"        ~09~                                 "RIGHT YOU ARE, WOODY, LET'S GO!"         ~09~                               "IT'S NO GOOD...RC ISN'T FAST ENOUGH  TO KEEP UP WITH THE TRUCK! WE NEED TO GO EVEN QUICKER..."                         ~09~                                "O.K. LET'S LIGHT THE ROCKET ON MY    BACK TO BOOST US AFTER THE TRUCK!     HOLD ON TIGHT...HERE WE GO..."             ~09~                               "WOODY!  BUZZ!   THEY WERE RIGHT HERE            IN THIS BOX!"                                                    "SEE", HIS MOTHER ANSWERS WITH A SMILE"I KNEW THEY'D TURN UP SOON ENOUGH!"                                        ANDY GIVES HIS FAVORITE TOYS A HUG AS WOODY BREATHES A BIG SIGH OF RELIEF.   THAT NIGHT, AFTER ALL THE TOYS WERE    UNPACKED, WOODY AND BUZZ TOLD THEM      ALL ABOUT THEIR BIG ADVENTURE.                                             "WHAT WE FOUND, IS THAT WE TOYS       HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER, EH BUZZ?"                                            "WOODY, I COULDN'T AGREE MORE."   FROM THAT DAY ON WOODY AND BUZZ WERE  BEST FRIENDS.  AND WHENEVER A NEW TOY CAME INTO THE BEDROOM, THEY WERE      WELCOMED AS FRIENDS AS WELL, FOR THE  TOYS HAD LEARNED A GREAT LESSON:      WHILE IT'S NICE TO BE ANDY'S FAVORITE,ALL A TOY REALLY NEEDS TO BE IS THE   BEST TOY IT CAN BE.

WHILE WOODY LOOKS FOR ANDY, BUZZ SPOTSA CLAW MACHINE. HE MISTAKES IT FOR A  SPACESHIP THAT CAN TAKE HIM BACK TO   SECTOR 4 AND JUMPS INTO IT!                                                 WOODY, KNOWING HE CAN'T FACE THE OTHERTOYS WITHOUT BUZZ, DIVES INTO THE     MACHINE AFTER HIM.                    "OOOOOOOO.                            A VISITOR...FROM THE OUTSIDE!"                                              "IF YOU WILL HELP SAVE OUR FRIENDS WHOARE TRAPPED INSIDE THE MACHINE WE WILLREWARD YOU BY TAKING YOU TO SEE..."                                                      "THE CLAW!"

IN HORROR, WOODY SEES SID, A KID WHO'SCRUEL TO ALL HIS TOYS, CONTROLS THE   CLAW... AND HE PLANS ON GETTING BUZZ!    "YOU MUST NOT FIGHT THE WILL OF                 THE CLAW!"                                                           "ALL MUST OBEY THE CLAW!"

WOODY, TRYING TO KEEP BUZZ FROM BEING TAKEN, GRABS BUZZ'S LEGS AND BEFORE   HE CAN LET GO, IS LIFTED UP INTO THE  AIR AS WELL,                                                                SMILING, SID MOVES BOTH TOYS TOWARDS  THE PRIZE CHUTE.                       "ALL RIGHT!  DOUBLE PRIZES! A BUZZ     LIGHTYEAR AND A STUPID COWBOY DOLL    ALL FOR A FEW MEASLY QUARTERS!                   HAHAHAHA!"                                                    SID STUFFS HIS NEW TOYS DEEP INTO HIS BACKPACK AND, WITH A SECOND EVIL LAUGHHEADS HOME TO...PLAY.                 SID CLOSES THE DOOR TO HIS BEDROOM ANDPULLS WOODY OUT OF HIS BACKPACK.                                            LIFTING UP A LARGE MAGNIFYING GLASS   TO CATCH THE SUN, SID TRAINS THE SPOT OF HOT LIGHT ON WOODY'S FOREHEAD...                                         "WHERE ARE YOUR REBEL FRIENDS NOW?!"  WHEN SID IS CALLED DOWNSTAIRS BY HIS  MOTHER, IT GIVES WOODY A CHANCE TO    LOOK AROUND THE BEDROOM FOR BUZZ...   WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO HIM?                                            AND UNKNOWN TO WOODY, LURKING IN THE  DARK SHADOWS, SOMETHING WAS WATCHING  HIS EVERY MOVE VERY CLOSELY...        "COME ON BUZZ, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!"                                      "WOODY, I'M NOT REALLY A SPACE RANGER.I'M JUST A TOY.  JUST A CHILD'S TOY."                                       "BUZZ, LISTEN TO ME, YOU'RE NOT ANY   CHILD'S TOY: YOU'RE ANDY'S TOY... AND YOU'RE HIS FAVORITE.  I...  UH OH..." "...SID!"                                                                   WITH AN EVIL LAUGH, SID PICKS UP BUZZ AND STRAPS A LARGE ROCKET TO HIS BACK.                                         "HOUSTON: WE ARE GO FOR LAUNCH!"                                           LAUGHING, SID TAKES BUZZ OUTSIDE.   WOODY, WITH LITTLE TIME TO SAVE BUZZ, CALLS OUT TO THE MUTANT TOYS...                                             "LOOK, THERE'S A GOOD TOY OUT THERE...AND HE NEEDS YOUR HELP... PLEASE."                                          THE TOYS WILL HELP, BUT TO GET TO BUZZTHEY'LL HAVE TO FACE SCUD, SID'S DOG! THE TOYS SAVE BUZZ BY SHOWING SID THEYARE REALLY ALIVE, WHICH SCARES SID SO BAD HE VOWS NEVER TO HURT TOYS AGAIN!                                       THE TOYS CELEBRATE UNTIL WOODY SEES A TRUCK LEAVING ANDY'S HOUSE NEXT DOOR.                                       "BUZZ!  ANDY'S MOVING WITHOUT US!"       "THANKS FOR COMING BACK, WOODY!"                                          "NO PROBLEM, BUZZ, BUT RIGHT NOW WE   HAVE TO CATCH BACK UP TO THAT MOVING  VAN BEFORE WE END UP AS LOST TOYS!"        ~09~                                 "RIGHT YOU ARE, WOODY, LET'S GO!"         ~09~                               "IT'S NO GOOD...RC ISN'T FAST ENOUGH  TO KEEP UP WITH THE TRUCK! WE NEED TO GO EVEN QUICKER..."                         ~09~                                "O.K. LET'S LIGHT THE ROCKET ON MY    BACK TO BOOST US AFTER THE TRUCK!     HOLD ON TIGHT...HERE WE GO..."             ~09~                               "WOODY!  BUZZ!   THEY WERE RIGHT HERE            IN THIS BOX!"                                                    "SEE", HIS MOTHER ANSWERS WITH A SMILE"I KNEW THEY'D TURN UP SOON ENOUGH!"                                        ANDY GIVES HIS FAVORITE TOYS A HUG AS WOODY BREATHES A BIG SIGH OF RELIEF.   THAT NIGHT, AFTER ALL THE TOYS WERE    UNPACKED, WOODY AND BUZZ TOLD THEM      ALL ABOUT THEIR BIG ADVENTURE.                                             "WHAT WE FOUND, IS THAT WE TOYS       HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER, EH BUZZ?"                                            "WOODY, I COULDN'T AGREE MORE."   FROM THAT DAY ON WOODY AND BUZZ WERE  BEST FRIENDS.  AND WHENEVER A NEW TOY CAME INTO THE BEDROOM, THEY WERE      WELCOMED AS FRIENDS AS WELL, FOR THE  TOYS HAD LEARNED A GREAT LESSON:      WHILE IT'S NICE TO BE ANDY'S FAVORITE,ALL A TOY REALLY NEEDS TO BE IS THE   BEST TOY IT CAN BE.
