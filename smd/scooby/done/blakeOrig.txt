Hey, where'd you go?~00~
I made you a sandwich, but you were gone, so I ate it.~00~
Uncle Blake is GONE!~00~
This is quite interesting!~00~
It was really nice of your Uncle Blake to let us spend the weekend at his hotel, Daphne.~00~
He says the snow is great this time of year. I can't wait to hit the slopes.~00~
No skiing for me, thanks. Like, skiing gets you broken legs!~00~
Reh! Roken Regs!~00~
Jinkies, you guys are such cowards! What are you going to do with yourselves all weekend if you don't ski with us?~00~
Room service!~00~
Reh! Reh!~00~
Hello, room service?  Another pizza, please.~00~
Two rizzas!~00~
To each his own, right guys?~00~
I think I see his hotel up ahead.~00~
Rooby Rooby Roo!~00~@14f80e
Hi, kids.  Looks like you'll have the place all to yourself.~00~@14f8be
Really?  I thought this was a busy time of year.~00~@14f9cc
It is.  Only this blasted ghost has been scaring off all my customers.~00~@14f9da
If this keeps up, I'll be bankrupt!~00~@14f9e8
G-g-ghost?~00~@14f9f0
I knew I shouldn't have said anything.~00~@14f9fe
We don't believe in Ghosts, Uncle Blake!~00~@14fa0c
Speak for yourself, Fred!~00~@14fa14
Uncle Blake, tell us about this ghost.~00~@14fa22
Not much to tell. He showed up about a month ago and started running me broke.~00~@14fa30
The gardener claims he's the ghost of the Ancient Chieftan.~00~@14fa3e
Who's the Ancient Chieftan?~00~@14fa4c
A long time ago, the Indians used this place as a burial ground.~00~@14fa5a
You mean like from India?~00~@14fa68
No, silly. He means Native Americans.~00~@14fa76
The Ancient Chieftan was a famous warrior around these parts about two hundred years ago.~00~@14fa84
They say he's buried nearby.~00~@14fa92
Why would the ghost of the Ancient Chieftan be haunting you?~00~@14faa0
I don't know for certain.~00~@14faae
But the gardener claims the Chieftan doesn't like his land being used for a hotel.~00~@14fabc
What I can't figure out is how come it took so long for him to get mad about it.~00~@14faca
Where was this ghost seen last?~00~@14fad8
The cook saw him across the river just yesterday.~00~@14fae6
Come on, guys. Let's check out that area.~00~@14faf4
Not me! I'm not going anywhere near any ghosts. I'm going to hit room service.~00~@14fb68
Sorry, son, but the staff all quit last week.~00~@14fb76
The only ones who stayed were the cook and the gardener.~00~@14fb84
If you talk to the cook nicely,maybe he'll make you something to eat.~00~@14fb92
Let's move inside where it's warm, hmm?.~00~@14fba4
Make yourselves at home.  I have some work to do~00~@14fbf6
 ~00~
Ancient Chieftan~00~
Excuse me...~00~
Yes?~00~
I've studied our history a lot, and I collect ancient artifacts, too.~00~
Like that kachina doll you're carrying.  Want to trade?~00~
I have an extra one in my collection.~00~
It's very nice.  And I would be most grateful.~00~
What do I get for it?~00~
I'll trade a ceremonial goblet.~00~
Many thanks, friend!~00~
Cool!  I'll trade!~00~
You will not regret this, I promise you!~00~
No way!  My doll is better!~00~
Suit yourself.  You're the one trying to finish this game, not me!~00~
How do you know that?~00~
It's my hobby.~00~
Cool.~00~
It's pretty neat, I think.~00~
Are you from around here?~00~
My people have been here for centuries.~00~
Have you seen Uncle Blake?~00~
No, but I wish I knew where he was. I need my paycheck.~00~
I think it's all some kind of scam.~00~
Aren't you scared of the ghost?~00~
Nope. I know a lot about my people's history, and I've never heard of this Ancient Chieftan character.~00~
Well, gotta go.~00~
Check out time is eleven SHARP.~00~
Bellhop~00~
Fred~00~
Velma~00~
Daphne~00~
Torches~00~
Villain~00~
It goes back to the tomb.~00~
Passage~00~
Zoinks! That must be worth a fortune!~00~
I wish!  But I can't get through the bars.~00~
Besides, I think it's probably evidence.~00~
Gold~00~
Gulp! Looks like at least somebody got out of the cuffs!~00~
Uh uh, man. NO WAY!~00~
Hand~00~
Somebody here has NO sense of humor!~00~
It's sort of DESIGNED not to move very far, man.~00~
Cuffs~00~
I think I hear something down there!~00~
The walls are too slippery.  I'd fall and splatter if I tried that!~00~
Hole~00~
It's the rope we used to climb down here.~00~
It's tied up top, remember?  I can't get it loose from down here.~00~
Besides, how would we get out if I moved it?~00~
Rope~00~
It's Uncle Blake.~00~
I was working in the office, and someone hit me.~00~
Next thing I knew, here I was.~00~
Can you get me out of here?~00~
How'd you get down here?~00~
Not sure.~00~
Don't worry, Uncle Blake. I'll get you out as soon as I can!~00~
Thanks, son!  I know I can count on you!~00~
They say there's a magic gold medallion hidden here in the tomb.~00~
That must be what the rascal is after!~00~
That statue over there has something to do with it,~00~
But I can't make out what.~00~
Something about a magic cup, it looks like.~00~
Blast!  It's no use.~00~
I just can't remember what some of these symbols mean.~00~
I used to have a book that would help me read them,~00~
but it went missing about a month ago.~00~
Come to think of it, that was when this ghost business started.~00~
What's so interesting?~00~
These writings!~00~
Okay, later.~00~
Good luck, son!~00~
What do I do with this amulet?~00~
I have a feeling someone wants it awfully bad.~00~
Then we say some magic words.~00~
Like, what magic words?~00~
Have you tried Abra-Cadabra?~00~
How about Ala-Kazam?~00~
Hocus Pocus, maybe?~00~
Um, Newport News?~00~
How about supercali-- no, that wouldn't be it.~00~
Oh, blast, I don't know. Make something up.~00~
What was it you said we needed to do to get the amulet again?~00~
We have to place a ceremonial goblet in the hands of the statue.~00~
I'll just be looking for the amulet.~00~
Good for you, son!~00~
Uncle Blake~00~
It's a wheel for the mine car.~00~
I need the rest of the wheels before I bother with that.~00~
Wheel~00~
Two wheels for the mine car.~00~
Three wheels for the mine car.~00~
Wheels~00~
It's missing three wheels.~00~
I can't use it without wheels!~00~
Well, I think it should work now.~00~
Come on, Scooby!  Let's ride!~00~
The lift engine isn't running.~00~
Let's ride, Scoob!~00~
Mine Car~00~
It looks like a wheel!~00~
It goes back to the basement.~00~
The track runs down a long way.~00~
Uh, uh.  That's way too steep!~00~
A fake!  It's really electric.~00~
I can't take it.  It's wired in.~00~
Lantern~00~
Wow!  Like, that could give you one king size headache!~00~
No way.  I'm not carrying that heavy thing around.~00~
Pick~00~

A creepy picture.  The eyes look weird.~00~@148b42
Picture~00~
Wonder who they'll get to push the gum, now?~00~@148b58
Zebra~00~
Nothing there but cobwebs.~00~@148b6e
Mailbox~00~
I like fires.  Too bad there's no marshmellows.~00~@148b84
I'm not THAT stupid.~00~@148b94
Fire~00~
Definitely better than the doll.~00~
I'd never be able to reach it.~00~
Goblet~00~
Fifth bottle from the left, third bottle down.~00~
What bottles?~00~
I can't see it from here.~00~
Yee-owch!  The fire is too hot.  I can't get it!~00~
Yeah!  That's gotta be the answer!~00~
Crumpled Note~00~
I bet this calls the Bellhop.~00~@148cf6
It doesn't work.~00~@148d22
Bell~00~
A door is a door is a door.~00~@148d38
It's already shut, man.~00~@148da0@148f12
It's already open.~00~@148dc0@148f22
Door~00~
Looks like a cafe in there!~00~@148b46
Archway~00~
Just some stairs.~00~@148e78
Stairs~00~
It goes outside.~00~@148eaa
Outside Door~00~
Double Doors~00~
Pretty.~00~
I already got that.~00~
Christmas Lights~00~
I can't quite reach them.~00~
I already tried that.  I can't reach them.~00~
Blake's Hotel~00~
Sign~00~
Looks kinda shakey to me.~00~
Totem Pole Bridge~00~
Like, for tornados.~00~
It's already closed.~00~
That's a pretty big lock!~00~
I can't open it with that lock on there!~00~
Locked Doors~00~
That's a lot of snow.  I'd need something besides my hands.~00~
Ungh!  Can't budge it.  The snow on top is too heavy.~00~
Snow Covered Doors~00~
Mental note:  mistake.~00~
For plugging stuff in.~00~
Outlet~00~
The front door.~00~
Main Entrance~00~
Looks like a shed over this way.~00~
Path to Shed~00~
No. I'll leave it as a memorial.~00~
It's a ratty snowman hat.~00~
Hat~00~
Pretty junky, actually.  Bet we could push it hard and it would fall over.~00~
That was a joke, okay?~00~
No way.  I can't REALLY push it over.~00~
I suppose you think this is a clever way of tricking me into pushing it from the other side?~00~
I can't open it with that lock on!~00~
Shed~00~
These don't look very warm, but they're pretty tough.~00~
These old gloves will protect my hands from the mega itching!~00~
Work Gloves~00~
Aren't you glad you're not a weed?~00~
Sayonara, Death Lettuce!~00~
Weed Killer~00~
Wonder why they call it a crowbar?  Doesn't look much like any crow I ever saw.~00~
This will never work.  That lock is too tough.~00~
No, I don't think Uncle Blake would appreciate that!~00~
Crowbar~00~
Nail~00~
That goes back to the front of the hotel.~00~
Path to Main Entrance~00~
MondoLok Lock Company.  Since 10 B.C.~00~
Guaranteed to withstand hammers, chisels, and...~00~
...nuclear explosions...~00~
I can see this being a problem.~00~
I gotta have a key to open this.~00~
Lock~00~
An accreted crystaline water homologue.~00~
Okay, but he doesn't look much like the conversational type to me.~00~
See what I mean?~00~
Hey, Snowman dude...~00~
...~00~
Snowman~00~
Like, it's the Jolly Green Giant's spoon, man!~00~
He hasn't made a mess yet.~00~
Sorry about this, Mr. Snowman, but we all have to make our sacrifices for the good of Blake's Hotel!~00~
Cowabunga!~00~
Shovel~00~
Nah.  Nothing worth seeing in there anymore.~00~
Cool!~00~
Whew!  Old fright face nearly had us!~00~
Hmm, looks like he gave up.  We're just too smart for him, I guess!~00~
He sure looked mad that time!~00~
Man, that was close!~00~
We finally lost Creepy Joe!~00~
This probably goes to the kitchen.~00~
It just wouldn't be the same without Scooby.~00~
I got an idea, Scoob.  Get over here.~00~
Whew!  We lost him, Scooby!~00~
Reh!  Whew!~00~
Dumb Waiter~00~
It's locked.~00~
The Stairs~00~
Television~00~
I think this is really a coat hanger.~00~
That's a little too technical for me.~00~
I guess I don't really want it after all.~00~
Antenna~00~
We used to have one of these hung up in the mystery machine.~00~
I don't need it right now.~00~
Air Freshener~00~
A drawer is a drawer is a drawer.~00~
Drawer~00~
Yikes!  And this guy is the gardener!~00~
No way!  I'll be itching for weeks if I touch that stuff!~00~
Nothing.  He can't feel a thing like that.~00~
No way.  We've bothered him enough, I think.  Let him sleep.~00~
Poison Oak~00~
Kinda like a tough slinky.~00~
I can't think of anything to do with them right now.~00~
Bed Spring~00~
This book tells how to read some funky writing.~00~
I bet this is the missing book!~00~
Boring.~00~
That's where it belongs, but I might need it.~00~
That's the book!  Now let's see here...~00~
Hmm...~00~
Here we are!~00~
We have to place a ceremonial goblet in the hands of the statue,~00~
Then say some magic words, and the medallion will appear.~00~
Hrumph, well, we have to use the goblet at any rate.~00~
I don't believe in this magic tomfoolery.~00~
You wouldn't happen to have an Indian ceremonial goblet by any chance, would you son?~00~
Book~00~
Pink medicine for your stomach.~00~
Wonder if it tastes good?~00~
Gosh, kid!  You really DO need food!~00~
I'll get you some right now!~00~
Antacid~00~
To Rudolph L. Blake, in appreciation for his many contributions to the Native American Museum.~00~
I'm sure Uncle Blake wants it to stay where it is.~00~
Plaque~00~
You know, for cutting stuff.~00~
Like pizza.~00~
No way, dude.  I might need it long like this.~00~
Snip!~00~
Scissors~00~
Like, it's completely invisible when it's closed.~00~
Zoinks! It's GONE!~00~
Trap Door~00~
There sure are a lot of books about Inidians up here.~00~
Book Collection~00~
One of the books is missing.~00~
I think that's a clue!~00~
Missing Book~00~
It's a little electric heater.  Nice and warm, too!~00~
Heater~00~
Zoinks!  That looks like Uncle Blake's writing!~00~
I hope he's okay!~00~
'Help!'~00~
Chalkboard~00~
They're some kind of Indian beads, I think.~00~
Here's some beads I found.~00~
Many thanks. But what I'm really looking for is a kachina doll.~00~
I found one in the woods a few days ago, but I must have dropped it on the way home.~00~
I could kick myself for that!~00~
Beads~00~
Mmm!  A meal fit for a king!~00~
Reh!  Reh!~00~
I have to open it, first.~00~
With my bare hands?~00~
Chili~00~
It's empty, but there's still gunk inside.~00~
A tasty little treat if I were small enough to get in there.~00~
The vent is in the way.~00~
That's it, dudes!  Dinnertime!~00~
Empty Chili Can~00~
A chili can with termites inside.~00~
Free at last!~00~
Now, let's go get those rapscallions who put me here!~00~
Relp! Relp!~00~
Zoinks!  Scooby's in trouble!~00~
Hurry then, and let's help him, son!~00~
He's gone!  What'll we do!~00~
Better start looking for him!~00~
Me, I have something that needs doing.~00~
Termites~00~
Hmm, water, faucet, basin, drain:  yup, it's a sink alright.~00~
Kitchen Sink~00~
I once saw a single termite eat a whole croquet ball!~00~
You know, I bet I could get this thing off if I had something to unscrew it with.~00~
Vent Cover~00~
It's a dumbwaiter.~00~
Hey, Scooby.  C'mere.~00~
Nah, not raw.  That'd be gross.~00~
Hey, there's some light back here!~00~
Ungh!  I can't lift it.~00~
It'll fall and bust if I do that.  It's too heavy to hold onto.~00~
Well, well!  I think this is the other side of that creepy painting in the lobby!~00~
Flour~00~
Shh!  Listen, scoob!~00~
Did you get Blake?~00~
Of course.~00~
He's in the dungeon.~00~
I don't trust you.  I want to see for myself.~00~
Then see.~00~
Here's the instructions on how to get down there.~00~
Got it.  Now get rid of that before someone sees it.~00~
No one will ever see it now!~00~
We have to get that note and find Uncle Blake, Scoob!~00~
Reh!~00~
Peephole~00~
Stove~00~
It's an old wood burning stove.~00~
Like, there's no wood, no matches.~00~
Besides, I don't have a clue how to run it.~00~
Even a swinging one.~00~
What!?  How did you...!~00~
You two get outtah here before I get really MAD!~00~
Kitchen Door~00~
Ten thousand watts of mega crisping power!~00~
Betcha could toast a few marshmellows in there, huh?~00~
It's already open, dude!~00~
It's already closed, dude!~00~
Microwave~00~
There's a bell inside this block of ice.~00~
Frozen Bell~00~
'To Bessie on graduation day.' Weird.~00~
Yes? May I help you?~00~
Nothing.~00~
Cow Bell~00~
A torture device for the hungry!~00~
I can just picture the goodies inside!~00~
It's pulled as far as I can pull it!~00~
It doesn't go any further, dude.~00~
Better close it first.~00~
Empty!~00~
How can it be empty?  It's a refrigerator!~00~
I feel so betrayed.~00~
I can't open it.  It's jammed against the wall.~00~
It's already shut, dude!~00~
Refrigerator~00~
It's just as empty as the fridge.~00~
Fridge Door~00~
The top from a soda can! Cool! I collect these!~00~
Bingo!~00~
Soda Tab~00~
'Eggs, cheese, bread, milk...'~00~
'Arsenic?' Creepy!~00~

There's water in this pot.  Hope it doesn't spill!~00~
Pot o' Water~00~
Looks heavy.  Bet it packs a whallop, though!~00~
Pot~00~
I wouldn't want to make him mad!~00~
Um, Mister Cook?~00~
Whaddya want, kid?~00~
Hey, get outtah here!  Employees only!~00~
S-s-sorry!~00~
Can't you just make us a quick hamburger?~00~
I'll make you INTO a hamburger if you don't stop bothering me!~00~
I NEED a pizza fix real soon!~00~
You're gonna need a body fix real soon!~00~
Nah, you guys don't need any food.~00~
Some cook you are, leaving poor kids to starve!~00~
Well..~00~
Hey, where's the chow?~00~
You kids look well fed.  Buzz off.~00~
Forget it.~00~
And don't come back!~00~
The Cook~00~
A cabinet is a cabinet is a cabinet.~00~
Cabinet~00~
Good for opening cans of all types.~00~
Slurp!~00~
Poor chili never had a chance!~00~
Can Opener~00~
Where's the ON switch?~00~
I can't reach it from this side.~00~
Snooping is one thing, but that's a little too close to stealing for me.~00~
Cash Register~00~
MondoLok Lock company.~00~
That cook will chop me to pieces if I go back there.~00~
Click~00~
That's got it!~00~
Key~00~
Hmm, this goes to the kitchen.  Yum!~00~
HEY!~00~
You can't go in there! Employees only.  Now scram.~00~
No way!  The cook is in there!~00~
You can't go back there! Employees only!  Beat it!~00~
Looks suspicious to me.~00~
Lamp~00~
I didn't know they still made old radios like this!~00~
It's already turned that way.~00~
I can't reach the battery compartment from here.~00~

Back to the lobby.~00~
Olive oil.  Wonder if it's okay to drink?~00~
Bottle of Oil~00~
Scooby~00~
Looks like a trap door.~00~
Craftsdude!  This is a sturdy screwdriver, alright.~00~
Screwdriver~00~
Stairs are stairs, dude.~00~
Zoinks! A trap door! That must be how they got Uncle Blake!~00~
Looks creepy to me!~00~
Secret Door~00~
Pretty beat up.  I bet if we push it...nah, skip it.~00~
Locker~00~
A rack with bottles in it.~00~
Rack~00~
Hook~00~
This runs the mine cars.~00~
Engine~00~
Perfect for transporting liquids of all kinds.~00~
Like, I already did that, man.~00~
That's an idea, but the gas will spill if I do that.~00~
I need to figure out what to do with the other end first.~00~
Hose~00~
Good for starting things.~00~
Switch~00~
Liquid petrolium product.~00~
Gas~00~
This goes to the mine, I guess.~00~
Exit~00~
Stone Path~00~
Ack!  It's awful!~00~
Pungeant Pond~00~
It's pretty dark in there.~00~
Looks sturdy enough.~00~
The smell is just too bad!~00~
Stone Bridge~00~
No way am I going any further.  I can't see a thing!~00~
Darkness!~00~
I can't read a word of it!~00~
Ancient Writing~00~
It goes back to the temple.~00~
That maze sure was easier the second time!~00~
Nobody home, I guess.~00~
I wonder if anyone is inside?~00~
Tomb~00~
It's made out of gold. I bet it's really valuable.~00~
Let's see who this rascal is!~00~
Jim the Gardener!~00~
We found the glowing paint he was using.~00~
And he's not the only one involved.~00~
Yeah!  Like, we saw the cook with him through the peep hole!  We heard everything!~00~
Tribal Police.  You're under arrest!~00~
You kids did great!  You should come and work for me.~00~
Like, thanks but no thanks, man.  I've had enough.~00~
Besides, we still have skiing to do!~00~
Scooby Doo!~00~
Medallion~00~
I think this thing is pretty old.~00~
Why am I talking to a rock?~00~
Um, Mr Statue?~00~
Abracadabra!~00~
Shazam!~00~
Hokus Pokus!~00~
Zoinks!  Who said that?~00~
Something's happening over here!~00~
You may look upon the medallion.~00~
XYZZY!~00~
You have proven yourself worthy.~00~
I give up.  Tell me.~00~
I think he's said all he's going to say.~00~
Statue~00~
It looks awfully creepy in there.~00~
No way am I going through that stuff!~00~
Hungarian Killer Lettuce!  Kills in an instant!~00~
Killer Lettuce~00~
Just normal rope, man.~00~
It's tied too tight.  I can't get it loose.~00~
Oh, thank heavens! I thought I was going to rot down here!~00~
Any luck yet?~00~
Say, wonder if we could catch anything?~00~
Nothing biting today, I guess.~00~
Pole~00~
It's some kind of old doll.~00~
Here's your doll, guy.~00~
Doll~00~
Zoinks!  It's looks hungry to me!~00~
I dunno what it is, but it's creepy enough to scare me.~00~
Maybe it's some spook trying to give us the evil eye!~00~
No way.  I'm not looking at it any more!~00~
Eyes~00~
It's the safest looking place around here.~00~
Safe up to ten zillion volts.~00~
I don't think that will help right now.~00~
Extension Cord~00~
Zoinks! I hope he doesn't wake up!~00~
Yikes! I hope he doesn't bite!~00~
You've got to be kidding!~00~
That would be suicide!~00~
Better let a sleeping bear lie.~00~
Bears eat people, not vice versa!~00~
Bear~00~
Do you think the guy that modelled for this got better?~00~
