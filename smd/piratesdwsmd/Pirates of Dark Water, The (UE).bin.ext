Greetings. My name is Mantus, second in command under Bloth.~0E~Excuse me for saying this, but I am a little surprised at what I see before me.~0E~I can't believe that you and your shipmates outwitted Konk and Joat.~0E~Those two idiots obviously underestimated you, but I am afraid I'm too intelligent to be tricked.~0E~I happen to be the greatest swordsman in the Land of Mer.~0C~It is a title that everyone takes seriously. That is why only Bloth and myself carry the last two Treasures of Rule.~0E~Enough with niceties. I have a Treasure of Rule in my chest.~0E~If you defeat me, which of course is impossible, you may freely take the Treasure.~0E~If I defeat you, I will gladly accept all of your gold.~0E~Oh, I do like a fight when there is gold involved!~0E~Are you ready?~0E~En-garde!!!~0E~~00~#762

;000000EC{Hello my child, give me your time, I have a story to tell.~0E~Ah Hum!~0E~Long ago there were Six Treasures of Rule, called so because of their magical powers against evil.~0E~The six Kings of Mer, including the King Primus of Octopon, sailed to the center of the Dark Dweller's whirlpool. With the protection of the treasures they journey'd safely down into the Dark Dweller's cave.~0C~Each king located a special plinth and placed in it a Treasure of Rule. The six treasures formed a seal, a protective barrier of Good.~0E~~0E~This was no easy task for the six kings. Except for King Primus, all the Kings were attacked and defeated by all manner of Dark Water creatures never seen before!!!~0C~Alone, King Primus placed the last seal and confronted the Dark Dweller. A long and hard battle ensued and the Dark Dweller was weakened. Sensing his weakness, the Six Seals joined together and formed the protective barrier. The DarkDweller was imprisoned within his own cave where he would remain forever.~0C~However, an unexpected earthquake took place within the cave. It's effect was disastrous! A small droplet of Dark Water escaped through the barrier. The hole grew larger and larger until it was big enough for the Dark Dweller to send Dark Water lakes to ravage the Lands of Mer.~0E~Although it could not escape, the Dark Dweller could rule the world from deep within its cave!!!~0C~Now, only a hero carrying the Six Seals can defeat the Dark Dweller. He will be sealed in his cave again and the Land of Mer will return to its former glory!~0E~You must go now. Bloth has the final Treasure of Rule and he is up on deck.~0E~Good luck in your quest.The love of King Primus will travel with you always.~0E~~00~}#1712#1670
